# Day 3: Global Theme Switcher (useContext)

## Problem Statement

Implement a **light/dark mode toggle** feature to enhance user experience by allowing users to switch between light and dark themes on a web application.

### Requirements

1. **Toggle Button**:
   - Provide a visually distinct button to switch between light and dark modes.
   - The button should be intuitive and accessible for all users.

2. **Theme Persistence**:
   - Use `localStorage` to persist the user's selected theme.
   - Ensure the application remembers the selected theme even after the user refreshes or revisits the page.

3. **Dynamic Theme Application**:
   - Apply theme styles dynamically based on the selected mode.
   - Ensure seamless and visually appealing transitions between light and dark modes.

#### Additional Considerations

- Ensure the implementation follows best practices for accessibility.
- Optimize the performance of the theme-switching functionality.
- Provide fallback behavior for browsers that do not support `localStorage`. - NOT IMPLEMENTED
